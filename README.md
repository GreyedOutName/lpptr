## Solutions

## 1.EBNF for simple  if-else if statement
```text
<preprocessor>::= "#include<iostream>" <directive>
<directive>::= "using namespace std;" <function>
<function>::= "int main () {" [<assignment> | <statements> | <return statement>]
<assignment>::= <type> <expression> ";"
<type>::= "int" | "float" | "bool" | "string"
<statements>::= <statement>
<statement>::= ["if" <condition>"{" <expression> ";" "}"| "else if" <condition> "{" <expression> ";" "}" | "else" "{" <expression> "}"]
<output>::=  "cout" "<<" <string> "<<" "endl" ";"
<expression>::= [<arithmetic> | <output>]
<arithmetic>::= (<variable> <operator> <term>";")
<operator>:="+" | "-" | "/" | "*" 
<condition>::= "("<variable> <comparator> <number> ")"
<comparator>::== "==" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" 
<term>::= <number>
<variable>::= <letter> | <variable><letter>
<number>::= <number><digit> | <digit>
<string>::= ["<variable> is less than <number>" | "<variable> is equal to <number>" | "<variable> is greater than <number>" ]
<letter>::= "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | .... |"A"|"B"|"C"|"D"|....|
<digit>::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | .... |
<return statement>::= return 0;
```

## 2. Parsing according to the grammar rules
This parsing is divided into several parts: the main function and its statements and a return statement.
The full view of the parsing in `txt` file is uploaded in this repository.

## 3. Visual Representation 
This activity uses the following libraries:
1. `lark-parser`, a Python toolkit for parsing all context-free languages. It is capable of parsing almost any programming languages.
[üåê Visit this repository](https://github.com/username/repository-name) for more `lark-parser` details.
2. `graphviz`, an open source graph visualization software. It is a wat of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
[üåê Visit this website](https://graphviz.org/) for more `lark-parser` details.

The output is as follows:
